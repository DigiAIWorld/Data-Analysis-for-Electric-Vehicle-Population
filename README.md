### About Data

* **Data:** This dataset lists the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently (April-2023) registered with the Department of Licencing (DOL) of Washington State (USA). 

* **You can get the data at:** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data

* **Task:** Using the provided dataset, we want to do exploratory data analysis (EDA). The EDA will serve as the foundation for the necessary Data Wrangling activities to be carried out for the purposes of data cleansing and normalization. During the coding process, we will document our observations. Eventually, we will produce a summary and draw conclusions from our findings.

### Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to thoroughly analyze the dataset in order to find important insights. The battery-electricÂ and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) that are currently registered with the Washington State Department of Licencing (DOL) are displayed in this dataset. Our goal was to develop a justification for the population of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

On the relevant dataset, we will apply **EDA** in an effort to observe and research the dynamics of churn transformation.
